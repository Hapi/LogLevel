README - loglevel
-----------------


DESCRIPTION
-----------
'loglevel' is a small command line utility to show and change a logging level of Java Loggers
(java.util.logging.Logger) and log4j loggers (org.apache.log4j.Logger) without restarting
the target JVM. With Java 1.5 to get this to work requires that the target JVM has been started
with -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.

With Java 1.6 or later things are easier. Of course, the above works perfectly well but with
Java 1.6 even if the target JVM has been started without -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote
the JMX agent can be started for the target JVM without restarting it. This can be achieved
by using the companion utility 'startjmx'.


REQUIREMENTS
------------
- Java 1.5 or later

Be aware that a dependency to Sun's tools.jar is a system dependency and thus needs to be set
accordingly if you are to compile this utility from the source. In Sun's reference implementation
(1.5) this artifact is called tools.jar but, for example, on Mac OSX 10.6 needed classes are in
classes.jar.

Also, when running the utility the same artifact must be found from the class path, of course.
